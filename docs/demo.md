# Demo

The demo can be done without having to set up the editor.

1. come up with block intent definitions
1. come up with sample code that can be rendered as blocks
1. come up with JS wrapper that can convert the set of intents wrappers to runnable office-script
1. can unwrap the intents if desired to convert

## Learning

High level intent view works well for the APIs

Do a slide by slide walkthrough of how this works.

Benefits

no new data format, just a mode to view code


Can add comments automatically to block
